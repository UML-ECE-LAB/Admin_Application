# Admin_Application
Smart Cabinet Admin App and GUI to provide Admin control over the Smart Cabinet.

The Admin Application allows the Smart Cabinet admins to add students/admins/inventory items to the Smart Cabinet system. It is easy to use, and comes as a terminal minimalistic version, and a GUI version. 

The GUI version has the option to accept a student's Roster to generate students' name suggestions. Name suggestions are generated using the Text_Auto_Complete_Algorithm, which is a former project of mine, found in my master branch. The Text_Auto_Complete_Algorithm uses the TRIE data structure to build a map of all the names, which makes generating suggestions highly efficient and scalable. 


# What I Learned:
- This project was a great review of the power of kivymd for Material Design GUI app development, specifically design based on keyboard input.
- TRIE data structure for generating name suggestions. 
- Delivering a fully functional, robust, and easy to use system is substantially more work than personal projects.
